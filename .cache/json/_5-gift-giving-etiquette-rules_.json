Not only do you have to choose a gift the person will like, but you also need to keep in mind whether it’s appropriate for the person and the occasion. Even more, you need to think about whether you should include a gift receipt, or how much to spend on the gift. At times, you may even wonder if it’s okay to not give a gift at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five gift-giving etiquette tips to help this process go smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-284 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/74b5ecf9baafe891fc67f1e365a1fe05/5-Gift-Giving-Etiquette-Rules.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Don’t ask people what they want.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you’re shopping for family members or close friends, you probably shouldn&#8217;t ask people what they want as a gift. This can make the recipient feel uncomfortable, and it can show as a lack of creativity or prioritizing. This can also put them in an awkward position- they won’t know what your budget is, or what stores you’ll have access to. They won’t ask for a pricey gift, as that can come off as demanding, but if they ask for something inexpensive, they may be asking for something they don’t really want. At the end of the day, the act of gift-giving is more about the sentiment or thought of the gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>If you’re giving a gift card, always present it with a note.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift cards can seem impersonal, but if you gift one with a personal note explaining why you thought this was the perfect gift, it can show that you had the recipient in mind when you bought it and not just taking the easy way out. Bonus tip: Add in an inside joke or a favorite quote to the personalized note to really make them smile!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Do buy off the registry.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, you don’t want to ask for a gift wish list, but registries are usually provided in the case of weddings and baby showers. If a registry is provided, you should buy something off of it, this way you’re giving the recipient something they actually want and will like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Gift receipts are always a good idea.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re ever wondering whether to include a gift receipt with your gift, the answer is almost always yes. This is an especially smart decision if you’re purchasing an expensive gift or a clothing item. This gives the recipient the flexibility to exchange the item for something that may fit better or is more of their taste. This also ensures your money doesn’t go to waste if the recipient ends up not liking the gift and your money goes to waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>If you’re giving gifts to some coworkers and not others, be discreet about it.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to give gifts to a few coworkers you’re close to in the office, make sure you do it in secret so those who didn’t receive one don’t feel left out or offended. If it’s an option, opt to bring in baked goods or other foods that you can share and enjoy with your whole team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift-giving shouldn’t be daunting! It’s a great way to bond with those you love and to create memories. Gift-giving etiquette is important to know so you can give the right gift, in the right way!</p>\n","author":{"node":{"avatar":{"url":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/static/56a959f97c2f4b74c2a838010bccc398/author@2.png?time=1623106183?time=1623106183"},"name":"Alice Key"}},"seo":{"metaDesc":"Gift-giving shouldn’t be daunting!
