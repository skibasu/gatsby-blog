Not only do you have to choose a gift the person will like, but you also need to keep in mind whether it’s appropriate for the person and the occasion. Even more, you need to think about whether you should include a gift receipt, or how much to spend on the gift. At times, you may even wonder if it’s okay to not give a gift at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five gift-giving etiquette tips to help this process go smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-284 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/74b5ecf9baafe891fc67f1e365a1fe05/5-Gift-Giving-Etiquette-Rules.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Don’t ask people what they want.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you’re shopping for family members or close friends, you probably shouldn&#8217;t ask people what they want as a gift. This can make the recipient feel uncomfortable, and it can show as a lack of creativity or prioritizing. This can also put them in an awkward position- they won’t know what your budget is, or what stores you’ll have access to. They won’t ask for a pricey gift, as that can come off as demanding, but if they ask for something inexpensive, they may be asking for something they don’t really want. At the end of the day, the act of gift-giving is more about the sentiment or thought of the gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>If you’re giving a gift card, always present it with a note.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift cards can seem impersonal, but if you gift one with a personal note explaining why you thought this was the perfect gift, it can show that you had the recipient in mind when you bought it and not just taking the easy way out. Bonus tip: Add in an inside joke or a favorite quote to the personalized note to really make them smile!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Do buy off the registry.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, you don’t want to ask for a gift wish list, but registries are usually provided in the case of weddings and baby showers. If a registry is provided, you should buy something off of it, this way you’re giving the recipient something they actually want and will like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Gift receipts are always a good idea.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re ever wondering whether to include a gift receipt with your gift, the answer is almost always yes. This is an especially smart decision if you’re purchasing an expensive gift or a clothing item. This gives the recipient the flexibility to exchange the item for something that may fit better or is more of their taste. This also ensures your money doesn’t go to waste if the recipient ends up not liking the gift and your money goes to waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>If you’re giving gifts to some coworkers and not others, be discreet about it.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to give gifts to a few coworkers you’re close to in the office, make sure you do it in secret so those who didn’t receive one don’t feel left out or offended. If it’s an option, opt to bring in baked goods or other foods that you can share and enjoy with your whole team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gift-giving shouldn’t be daunting! It’s a great way to bond with those you love and to create memories. Gift-giving etiquette is important to know so you can give the right gift, in the right way!</p>\n","author":{"node":{"avatar":{"url":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/static/56a959f97c2f4b74c2a838010bccc398/author@2.png?time=1623106183?time=1623106183"},"name":"Alice Key"}},"seo":{"metaDesc":"Gift-giving shouldn’t be daunting!

We’ve been friends since we were 15, and even though I’ve moved and changed my phone number and address about 14 times, Stephanie still finds a way to send me a birthday gift each year. Seriously, she never forgets!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me on the other hand&#8230;I’m not as good at remembering important dates. Between my job, my spouse, immediate family, nieces, nephews, friends, loved ones, and various holidays, it’s hard to keep track of all of the special days of the year. When you try to keep track of everyone’s birthdays, anniversaries, special days, and how long it’ll take for their gift to arrive, <em>on top of living your best life,</em> sending a gift can (and often does) fall through the cracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-267 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/c959d6c21e19fef60be0b4ffa59dad34/Frame-1.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, we all find ourselves scrambling at the last minute to get a gift when we <em>finally</em> realize it’s someone’s birthday or it’s a special holiday. By the time we remember these days (which is usually the day of), we don’t really have many options- good options, anyway. I realized that any gift options available would either take too long to be delivered to that person, were extremely expensive, or require information like addresses and emails that I certainly can’t remember. Most importantly, the gifts felt last-minute and I realized it made my loved ones feel like an afterthought, which I hate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-269 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/cb174e35b9c4ca45645ef6f379ec96eb/Frame-2.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I love automation and common-sense solutions. The simpler, the better! I wanted a tool that not only did a great job at reminding me of the important dates in my life, but also gave me the ability to send thoughtful, personalized, physical, and digital gifts both proactively and last minute. To add icing on the birthday cake, this solution needed to be able to do so extremely quickly- to be able to send a gift even if all I had was someone’s phone number or social media handle. Even more, I wanted options whether I wanted to spend $20 or $200 because, no, I don’t want to spend $150 on a last-minute office gift for my new coworker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the thing- apps similar to this idea of Bō do exist. Sorta. No one really knows about them because their branding makes it look like you’re just as likely to have your identity stolen as you are to send a last-minute gift to your friend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I came up with was Bō. I wanted to take the best features of some of the existing tools, merge them together, and put an intuitive and easy-to-understand UI wrapper on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-271 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/68d10f04b205b1d2b2f815788f60a64f/Frame-3.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What can you expect from Bō? Gift automation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be able to send shareable links to your digital address book to collect addresses and birthday dates. Bō will even send you auto-reminders for special holidays, like Mother’s Day, so you don’t forget <em>anything </em>important- we don’t want to disappoint Mom with a thoughtless gift!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, what if you don’t get responses to your digital address book in time? No worries! Bō will give you the ability to send a gift without an address or email. You’ll be able to buy now, and collect any information from your loved ones later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those times when you’re trying your best to write a heartfelt message to go along with your amazing gift but can’t seem to come up with anything? Bō will have pre-written messages for your loved ones when you can’t find the words and need some inspiration. No more boring generic messages!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1024px\" class=\"wp-image-273 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/f430cc5fcd747e95d9c2aa0debbe7239/Frame-4.png?time=1623106183\" data-reactroot=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bō will have so many features that will help you make your loved ones feel amazing on their special days. And this creation came from me- Jay, a small-town Ohio-born IT guy with a passion for automation- and my experiences as a way to ensure my loved ones didn’t feel forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bō comes out soon- make sure to join our waitlist to be one of the first to know when it’s released! </p>\n","author":{"node":{"avatar":{"url":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/static/56a959f97c2f4b74c2a838010bccc398/author@2.png?time=1623106183?time=1623106183"},"name":"Alice Key"}},"seo":{"metaDesc":"","title":"The Story Behind Bō - Blog","opengraphImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Frame-1.png?time=1623106183"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Gift Giving 101"}]},"date":"2021-05-14T09:32:00","featuredImage":null}],"acf":[{"blockBlogHero":{"description":"Keep track of all your loved one’s special days and send them the perfect present at the perfect time.","title":"<span class=\"orange\">Thoughtful gifts</span> for <br/>your favorite people "},"title":"Blog","seo":{"metaDesc":"Modify your description here ...","title":"Blog Page Gatsby","opengraphImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cover_02.png?time=1623106183"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.220.85/n4g.891.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Cover_02.png?time=1623106183"}}}]}}
